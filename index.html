            </h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Virat Kohli  born 5 November 1988 is an Indian international cricketer who plays Test and ODI cricket for the Indian national team. A former captain in all formats of the game, Kohli retired from the T20I format following India's win at the 2024 T20 World Cup. He's a right-handed batsman and an occasional unorthodox right arm quick bowler. Kohli holds the highest IPL run-scorer record, ranks second in T20I, third in ODI, and stands the fourth-highest in international cricket.[4] Regarded as one of the greatest batsman of all time, he also holds the record for scoring the most centuries in ODI cricket and is second in the list of most international centuries scored in international cricket.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">In 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen. In 2015, he achieved the summit of T20I rankings.[7] In 2018, he was ranked top Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one spot in all three formats of the game. He is the first player to score 20,000 runs in a decade. In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade.</p>

            <p class="lb_text">He made his List A debut for Uttar Pradesh in the 2018–19 Vijay Hazare Trophy on 21 September 2018.[3] He made his first-class debut for Uttar Pradesh in the 2018–19 Ranji Trophy on 1 November 2018.[4] He made his Twenty20 debut for Uttar Pradesh in the 2018–19 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy on 21 February 2019.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">In February 2022, he was bought by the Gujarat Titans in the auction for the 2022 Indian Premier League tournament for a whopping 3.2 crores in the auction, which was a considerably higher bid for an uncapped player.[6][7] He made his IPL debut on 13 April 2022, against Rajasthan Royals.[8] However his rise to fame came in a negative limelight as he couldn’t defend 29 runs in the final over the IPL league match against Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2023 season with Rinku Singh smacking him for 5 sixes in that over. He had one of worst four-over spells in IPL history in that game, giving away 69 runs, only one run short of the worst spell at that time. He was released by Gujarat Titans after the season.</p>
